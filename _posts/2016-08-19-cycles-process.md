# Cycles, Process

I took some time to make architecture, then I took some time to make sound. Then I tried to bring it all together. That worked somewhat. Then I took some time to make bigger architecture. A ghost is leaving my body to make bigger sound. I need to support that ghost.

There is a room where a sound can rattle around, bounce back and forth, forever, never losing energy, like a photon whose constant is its speed.
